# rigolScreenGrab
Grabs the current screen of a Rigol oscilloscope (Tested on an MSO5074, but I am sure it can easily be adapted for other scopes.)

Python 3, doesnt use a whole host of libraries that hide the implemenation.

Has the correct amount of tabs and spaces Python requires.

Usage python screen.py [delay in seconds]

Good for doing frequency drift measurements over a long time.
